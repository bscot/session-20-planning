    "1. How LS relates to classical periodogram relates to PSD (they are estimators of PSD) -- (also, why can't we just take the FT? i.e. we don't know signal)\n",
    "2. Sketch derivations of LS: smart choice of coefficients (Scargle) + least squares (Lomb)\n",
    "3. Some useful extensions: uncertainties (6.1), floating mean (6.2), higher-order modes (6.3)\n",
    "4. Computing the window function & the CLEAN algorithm\n",
    "5. FAPS and eFAPS\n",
    "6. When the LS periodogram fails: ex: P/2 being isolated in rotation curve. \n",

    "8. When the LS periodogram fails: low SNR, window function peaks or aliases being confused for real peaks\n",
