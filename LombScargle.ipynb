    "The Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram provides a framework for analyzing datasets like this one. However, it's not a perfect tool! The more you understand about how it works, the less likely you will be to misinterpret a LS periodogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we choosing to focus on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram? There are many, many other methods for detecting periodicity in \"real\" data, which broadly fall into the following categories:\n",
    "- Fourier methods, which are derived from the Fourier transform\n",
    "- Phase-folding methods\n",
    "- Least-squares methods, and\n",
    "- Bayesian methods\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not really separate categories; for example, one can construct a probability function using a phase-folding or least-squares method, then incorporate it into a Bayesian analysis. There are two main reasons that we are devoting so much time to the LS periodogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason #1: It's super popular! You are very likely to encounter the LS periogoram in time-series analysis, so it's important to have a solid understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason #2: It is related to all four \"classes\" of methods above. It can be derived from Fourier theory (which we will show), and can also be viewed as a least-squares method (which we will also show). We won't discuss this, but it can also be derived from Bayesian probability theory and is closely related to phase-folding techniques. Therefore, gaining intuition about the LS periodogram will help you understand many of these methods, and give you a baseline for understanding other techniques."
